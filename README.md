# Chess Openings 101
ChessOpenings101 is a web page created for a university project, where one may find educational content with regards to chess openings, as the name implies. It includes an introductory page, a page about basic chess openings, a page about some slightly more advanced concepts and a page where users may take tests to test their knowledge.
Users also have the option to register. A registered user may submit questions for a test, which are then accepted or denied by a moderator. A registered user has access to dynamically generated tests based on submitted questions. Those tests support 3 difficulties. For registered users, the results of the tests are saved and may be accessed again at a later date.
Users may also edit their profiles, as can moderators.
